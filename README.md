# todo-sorter

Manually do the comparison phase of a sorting algorithm

I think the real value of this project for now is awareness. `input.txt` provides some good insights into what the idea could be used for. However in my case it turned out that this project was imminent, time-consuming and in the end boring, making the priority of the project actually lower than it initally was.

## Run
```sh
amm TodoSorter.sc
```
